# VFXProgramming

Visual Effects (VFX) is a process by which imagery is created, manipulated, or enhanced for filmmaking and video production. It enables filmmakers to enhance a story by bringing monsters, believable characters, worlds, special effects, and stunts to life. As a computer programmer, this is a field that greatly interests me, especially in the use of different graphical algorithms in VFX. This series is a collection of code samples that details my learning journey on VFX with Apple's Core Image, CIFilter, and Metal.
